# Grocery_List
A website to automate my personal grocery shopping list

Items are divided into multiple categories based off of what kind of product they are (such as produce, dairy, meats, etc.) and are divided into one of a few priorities, ranging from URGENT (completely out and needed to get the next trip) to WE HAVE (signifying that we currently have that item at home)
